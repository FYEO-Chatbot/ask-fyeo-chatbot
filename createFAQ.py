#         "When do you recommend taking your liberal studies?\nThis varies for every student. Some students decide to take it in the Fall along with the required 5 (or less courses) and some decide to do them in the spring or in upper years. **We donâ€™t encourage a full course load (of 6 courses) especially with online learning.**\nAll Engineering students are required to complete four Liberal Studies Courses as per their graduation requirements. You do not have to take your Liberal courses in your first year of study; liberal courses just have to be completed before you apply to graduate. Many students use the Spring/Summer term to complete their liberals or complete them in their later years so they can concentrate more on their Engineering courses, especially in their first year. In total, students must take TWO (2) Table A - Lower Level Liberals, ONE (1) Table B - Upper Level Liberal, and ONE (1) Engineering Upper Level Liberal. \n\nPlease note that first-year engineering midterms are often held on Fridays from 6 p.m. - 8 p.m., so you should ensure that you do not enroll in a Liberal studies course that conflicts with this time.\n"
