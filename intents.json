The test is held three times a year: end of August (during orientation), November, and late April/early May. If you are unable to write it that day, please email firstyeareng@ryerson.ca to let us know. There will be 3 opportunities to write the test each year; end of August, November and late April/ May.

                "If you don't pass the WST, you will receive a grade of INP (in-progress) in CEN 199, and are  encouraged to enroll in LNG 111, LNG 112, LNG 113, or LNG 121, depending on the outcome of the WST assessment. These are writing-intensive humanities and social science courses designed to give you the opportunity to strengthen your foundation in communication. They also count as lower-level liberal studies courses.\n\nIf you don't pass your second attempt at the WST, or you just want to further develop your language and writing skills after completing the LNG courses, you may benefit from Toronto Metropolitan's online and/or in-class preparatory English language courses offered through the <a href=\"https://continuing.torontomu.ca/\"> G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education</a>.\n\nNote: You may not proceed into the third year of your engineering program without passing the WST. But if you don't pass the test during orientation, you will have more chances to write and pass the test.\n\nA reminder that students are not encouraged to take the first Table A listed in the calendar in the first Fall or Winter semester.\n"
